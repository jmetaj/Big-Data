<h1>University Project README</h1>

<h2>Purpose:</h2>

This project aims to familiarize students with current Big Data storage, retrieval, and analysis technologies, specifically Cassandra. 
It explores various aspects of managing and analyzing Big Data.

<h2>Data:</h2>

<li>Four CSV files used for this project, RAW_interaction, RAW_recipe data, PP_recipes and PP_users. </li>
<li>You can download the data from <a href = https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/shuyangli94/food-com-recipes-and-user-interactions /a> Kaggle.</li>

<h2>Database Design:</h2>

<li>Cassandra is used, which doesn't support joins like traditional databases.</li>
<li>I've designed tables to efficiently support a recipe search and selection user interface.</li>

<h2>User Needs: </h2>

<li>Users can discover popular recipes, search by keywords, filter by difficulty, and access detailed recipe information.</li>
<li>Explore top recipes associated with specific labels.</li> 
<br>
This README offers a quick overview of the project, dataset, database design, and user features.
