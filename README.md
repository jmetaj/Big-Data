#University Project README

##Purpose:

This project aims to familiarize students with current Big Data storage, retrieval, and analysis technologies, specifically Cassandra. 
It explores various aspects of managing and analyzing Big Data.

##Data:

+Four CSV files used for this project, RAW_interaction, RAW_recipe data, PP_recipes and PP_users.
+You can download the data from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/shuyangli94/food-com-recipes-and-user-interactions).

##Database Design:

+Cassandra is used, which doesn't support joins like traditional databases.
+I've designed tables to efficiently support a recipe search and selection user interface.

##User Needs:

+Users can discover popular recipes, search by keywords, filter by difficulty, and access detailed recipe information.
+Explore top recipes associated with specific labels.
This README offers a quick overview of the project, dataset, database design, and user features.
